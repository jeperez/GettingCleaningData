### The Guide for interpreting each variable

- X, Y, Z: the axis of X, Y and Z (signals can be in the X, Y and Z directions)
- t (at the beginning of the variable names): time domain signals
- f (at the beginning of the variable names): frequency domain signals
- mean: Mean value
- std: Standard deviation
- meanFreq: Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
- angle: Angle between to vectors
- Acc: Acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer (sensor signal).
- Gyr: Angular velocity from the smartphone gyroscope (sensor signal).
- Body: The signals related to the body of subject (individual) who has been examined.
- Jerk: Jerk signals (the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to reach this signal)
- Mag: magnitude of the three-dimensional signals calculated using the Euclidean norm
- Gravity: The signals related to the gravity.
- Subject: The numbers between 1 to 30 which are identifiers of the subjects (individuals) who carried out the experiment.
- Activity: including 6 activities performed by subjects (STANDING, SITTING, LAYING, WALKING, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, WALKING_UPSTAIRS)

### Data Transformation Steps

Following data transformations are carried out by the `run_analysis.R` script.

1. For each of the training and test datasets, 
    1. Read the `X` values
    2. Take a subset of the columns representing only the mean and standard deviation values. Subsetting is done early on to conserve memory.
    3. Associate additional columns to represent activity IDs and subject IDs read from `y_<dataset>.txt` and `subject_<dataset>.txt` files respectively.
    4. Assign column names by manipulating the measurement names in `features.txt` to remove spaces and convert them to camel case.
2. Merge the training and the test sets, read as in step 1 to create one data set.
3. Associate an additional column with descriptive activity names as specified in `activity_labels.txt`.
4. Melt the dataset by specifying activity ID, name and subject ID as the only ID variables.
5. Re cast the melted dataset with activity name and subject id as the only IDs and `mean` as the aggregator function.
6. Save the result in re-casted dataset as `tidy.txt`

The descriptive names of each activity (instead of numbers) were used to describe the activities properly.
From the whole variables we just chose the variables with mean and standard deviation measurements the names of which are listed above.
It reduced the number of columns to 88 (taking into account that two columns were related to "activity" and "subject").
Finally an independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject was created.
The dimension of the final data set was 88 columns and 180 rows.
Each rows indicates the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

### Variable Descriptions

The data for this data set was derived from sources mentioned in the "Original data" section of this document. Part of the description below has been taken from the original data description.

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag).

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals).

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern: '-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are:
- mean: Mean value
- std: Standard deviation
